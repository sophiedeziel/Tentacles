The default behavior with no parameters is to home all axes.\n\nIn order to improve positional accuracy, the homing procedure can re-bump at a slower speed according to the `[XYZ]_HOME_BUMP_MM` and `HOMING_BUMP_DIVISOR` settings.\n\nThe position is easy to lose when the steppers are turned off, so homing may be required or advised after the machine has been sitting idle for a period of time. See the Configuration files for all homing options.\n"},"G29":{"structuredDoc":{"tag":"g029","title":"Bed Leveling","brief":"Probe the bed and enable leveling compensation","author":"thinkyhead","pagetype":"toc","requires":"AUTO_BED_LEVELING_(3POINT|LINEAR|BILINEAR|UBL)|MESH_BED_LEVELING","group":"calibration","codes":["G29"]},"mdDescription":"\nWhen you build Marlin you have the option to include one of 5 different bed leveling systems. Each leveling system comes with its own set of options and makes `G29` behave differently, so documentation for these G-codes is divided up into 5 separate pages.\n\n### Mesh-based Leveling\nMesh leveling measures the height of the bed at several points to generate a 3D mesh representing bed imperfections. With compensation enabled, the nozzle follows the bed contours by dynamically adjusting the Z position (using bilinear interpolation between the measured points). The nozzle follows the contours of the bed more accurately with more mesh points and/or finer segmentation of moves.\n\n- [Mesh Bed Leveling](/docs/gcode/G029-mbl.html) provides an economical interactive manual mesh-based leveling system for small boards or machines without a probe. Marlin provides a UI but an LCD controller is not required.\n\n- [Auto Bed Leveling (Bilinear)](/docs/gcode/G029-abl-bilinear.html) provides mesh-based bilinear leveling, either with or without a probe (but not both).\n\n- [Unified Bed Leveling](/docs/gcode/G029-ubl.html) provides mesh-based bilinear leveling with partial probing and many options to fit a mesh to the whole bed. Planar (matrix) operations can be applied to the mesh data, but active compensation is mesh based.\n\n### Matrix-based Leveling\nWith matrix-based leveling the height of the bed is measured at three points, or in a grid, to generate a rotation matrix. This matrix is used to rotate points in 3D space relative to the tilt of the bed. So if you print an object on a tilted surface the entire object is tilted. This system assumes the bed is perfectly flat, so it is most suitable for high end machines.\n\n- [Auto Bed Leveling (Linear)](/docs/gcode/G029-abl-linear.html) provides matrix-based Linear (least-squares) leveling, with or without a probe.\n\n- [Auto Bed Leveling (3-Point)](/docs/gcode/G029-abl-3point.html) provides matrix-based 3-point leveling, with or without a probe.\n"},"G30":{"structuredDoc":{"tag":"g030","title":"Single Z-Probe","brief":"Probe bed at current XY location","author":"thinkyhead","since":"1.0.0-beta","requires":"HAS_BED_PROBE","group":"calibration","codes":["G30"],"parameters":[{"tag":"C","optional":true,"description":"Probe with temperature compensation enabled (`PTC_PROBE`, `PTC_BED`, `PTC_HOTEND`)","values":[{"type":"bool","default":1}]},{"tag":"X","optional":true,"description":"X probe position","values":[{"tag":"pos","type":"float"}]},{"tag":"Y","optional":true,"description":"Y probe position","values":[{"tag":"pos","type":"float"}]},{"tag":"E","optional":true,"description":"Engage the probe for each point","values":[{"type":"bool","default":0}]}],"notes":["Use `SERIAL_FLOAT_PRECISION` to set the number of decimal places in the output."]},"mdDescription":"\nDo a single Z probe at a specified position.

However, with a `POWER_LOSS_PIN` Marlin only writes the recovery info when a power-loss is actually detected.
